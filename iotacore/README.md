# Iotacore for easygiro


* Iotacore will be in charge of controlling money transactions. 

* As example we can interact with MAINET, using a python or go library 
(this is before we have our own node, that would be terraformed) for this purpose 
we use: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py

## hello world
* See iota.lib/examples/helloworld

## Tests


## Requirements 
To test the interactions with IOTA using Pyota you have to install
the folowing dependencies. 

* pip install pyota
* pip install pyota[ccurl]
