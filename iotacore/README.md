# Iotacore for easygiro


* Iotacore will be in charge of controlling the money transfer transactions. 

* As example we can interact with MAINET, using a python or go library 
(this is before we have our own node, that would be terraformed) for this purpose 
we use: https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py
